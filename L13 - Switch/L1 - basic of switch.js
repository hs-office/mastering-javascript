/*
ðŸ§  What is a switch statement?
The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
Itâ€™s a cleaner alternative to writing many if...else if...else
statements when checking the same variable.

/*
ðŸ§© What happens here?
 * The switch looks at the value of color.
 * If it's 'red', 'blue', or 'green', it runs the matching case.
 * If it doesnâ€™t match any case, the default block runs.
 * break tells JavaScript to stop checking other cases after
   a match is found.
