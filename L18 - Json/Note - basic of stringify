 What JSON.stringify() does:
 It changes the object into a string format.

 Why JSON.stringify() exists?
 Problem:
 You want to send this object to:
 * API
 * Database
 * Save as text in file
 Those systems cannot accept an object. They only accept a string.

 What JSON.stringify() does:
 It changes the object into a string format.

 //eg:
 let a = JSON.stringify(user);
 console.log(a)

 // output:
 '{"name":"hs","age":25}'

 Important:
 * Before stringify: it’s an object, you can use .name
 * After stringify: it’s a string, you CANNOT use .name
