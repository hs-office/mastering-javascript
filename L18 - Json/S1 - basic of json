BASIC SUMMARY: WHAT IS JSON?

JSON stands for:    JavaScript Object Notation

What is JSON used for?
JSON is used to store data and send data between systems.
Itâ€™s the most common format for:
 * APIs
 * Databases
 * Config files
 * Sending data from front-end to back-end

// eg: js object
let user = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25
}

- transform to json using JSON.stringify()

// after transform to json
'{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}'

why need of json
| Reason         | Why                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Send to API    | API cannot accept objects, only text |
| Save to file   | File stores plain text               |
| Database store | Store text, not JS object            |

eg: json api
{
    "status": "success",
    "user": "hs",
    "role": "admin"
}

When received in JavaScript, this will look like:

    '{"status":"success","user":"hs","role":"admin"}'

It's just a string until you parse it.
