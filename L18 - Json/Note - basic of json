/*
 What is JSON?
 JSON = JavaScript Object Notation
 It’s just data written as a string, used for sending
 information between systems.
 Looks like JavaScript: object, but inside quotes (' ').
 */

// eg: js object
let user = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25
}

- transform to json using JSON.stringify()

// when transform to json
'{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}'

Notice:
 * Everything is in double quotes (" ")
 * It’s a string, not an object (you can't use
   .name until you parse it)

 Why JSON.stringify() exists?
 Problem:
 You want to send this object to:
 * API
 * Database
 * Save as text in file
 Those systems cannot accept an object. They only accept a string.
